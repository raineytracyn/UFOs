# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview of the Project
### This provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters have been added for the city, state, country, and shape.
- Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- A written report on the UFO analysis

## Results

## Summary
### Now, the page looks clean and allows the end user to filter through the different sightings in our data set using the search bars created. 

## Drawback
### A drawback to our search bar is trying to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the sighting. that would be a helpful element to in validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be.

## Recommendations
- Recommendation: To have additional information on how many people were at the site.
- Recommendation: Adding another filter to find the sightings by length and last but not least have a site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sightings to our page.
