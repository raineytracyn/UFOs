# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
### This provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters have been added for the city, state, country, and shape.
- Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- A written report on the UFO analysis
## Results
### By adding additional filters, an end-user will spend less time manually reading through each line to find what he or she wants. It also enables an end user to do a quick anaylsis of what areas see more acitivies verses others by the number of submissions.

## Summary
### Now, the page looks clean and allows the end user to filter through the different sightings in our data set using the search bars created. 

## Drawback
### A drawback to our search bar is trying to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the sighting. that would be a helpful element to in validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be.

## Recommendations
- Recommendation: To have additional information on how many people were at the site.
- Recommendation: Adding another filter to determine sightings by region. There are many areas where a sightening can be seen from the next state over.
